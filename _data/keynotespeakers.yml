  abstract: This Halloween, delve into the eerie realm of Internet hate forums and discover the chilling, real-life tale of an unassuming man who is mercilessly pursued by a novel breed of cyber aggressor. The innovative research of our Keynote Speaker, grounded in firsthand interactions with these perpetrators, reveals the terrain of the Socially Motivated Threat Actor. These networked adversaries distinctively manipulate both digital infrastructures and human procedures, operating en masse and through specific engagements, to exert influence and inflict damage upon their selected targets. For security professionals, grasping this evolving dimension is essential for reducing uncertainty and crafting an efficient defensive approach in the face of a cyberattack.

            Humankind are deep down the software rabbit hole. Billions of us depend upon software that doesn't expose each of us to undue risk. Our                     dependence reaches far beyond those of us rich enough to work from cafes. Herders and subsistence farmers rely on their mobile phones for                   critical services even if these people live outside the "internet bubble". Who writes this software? Tens of millions of programmers across the             globe. Most of these do not work at "Enterprises" or even SMBs (Small Medium Businesses). And yet, every single one of these programmers can               add to our collective AppSec burden, i.e., exploitable conditions. If AppSec is to be truly global, we must embrace the challenges of a world               of software and software developers in order to truly be "global".
